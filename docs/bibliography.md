## Potential Engines ##
1. [Unity](https://unity.com)
   > - Unity is a popular game engine utilized by many professional developers. It can be used to create both 2D and 3D games supported on many platforms. This is a mainstay in the industry.
2. [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US)
   > - Unreal Engine was originally created for first-person shooters, but has since become a powerful tool for 3D game creation. It has an emphasis on graphical fidelity, and thus is slightly
   > difficult for beginners to get a grasp on. Again, this is used for some of the most popular games out there.
3. [Godot](https://godotengine.org)
   > - Godot is an open-source, cross-platform, free game engine that supports 2D and 3D games. It utilizes a hierarchy of nodes to  organize the development process.
   > Nodes are organized inside of "scenes", which are reusable, instanceable, inheritable, and nestable groups of nodes. Godot is geared towards smaller development teams, as well as those
   > with less knowledge in the realm of game development.
