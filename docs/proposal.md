Idea: a top-down roguelite that has an emphasis on fighting, has separate regions you can travel to. Online multiplayer would be ideal, probably P2P. There would be progression for the character outside of the main gameplay loop.
That loop would consist of traveling to a specific area on the region map, then navigating each area until you reach a boss zone. Each region map would be a grid which would be nondescript at the beginning of a playthrough, then would provide
more information as you move from tile(area) to tile. The goal is to visit tiles that have items to earn before tackling a boss area, in order to make that fight easier. There could be some sort of indicator that tells you 
how close you are to a boss zone(although this might be better as a semi-common item). Non-boss tiles could have item pickups, mystery events that could give you positive or negative effects, or treasure hordes that would add 
to your overall coin count which would carry over across runs. The player character might be an alien, visiting different planets(the regions), rocketing down to whichever tile you pick at the start of a run. You finish 
a planet by beating the boss. Each planet would have its own unique creatures and environments, and I would try to avoid making each tile seem identical by varying the fighting styles of different creatures in 
different areas. I would most likely utilize pixel art to make the sprites and game world.

Engine: Over the summer, I looked into several game engines, but Godot seemed to stick out as a fairly intuitive option. It's open-source, using C++, C#, and it's native GDScript. You build 2D and 3D games using a hierarchy of nodes, organized inside of reusable scenes. Halls of Torment was built on Godot, which is partially why I was drawn to it.
