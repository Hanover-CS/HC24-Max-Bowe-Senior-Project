Idea: a top-down roguelite that has an emphasis on fighting, has separate regions you can travel to. Online multiplayer would be ideal, probably P2P. There would be progression for the character outside of the main gameplay loop.
That loop would consist of traveling to a specific area on the region map, then navigating each area until you reach a boss zone. Each region map would be a grid which would be nondescript at the beginning of a playthrough, then would provide
more information as you move from tile(area) to tile. The goal is to visit tiles that have items to earn before tackling a boss area, in order to make that fight easier. There could be some sort of indicator that tells you how close you are to
a boss zone(although this might be better as a semi-common item). Non-boss tiles could have item pickups, mystery events that could give you positive or negative effects, or treasure hordes that would add to your overall coin count which would carry over across runs.
